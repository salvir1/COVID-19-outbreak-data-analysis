    "# COVID Early Warning System Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an attempt to define a good early warning indicator for COVID outbreaks. States and public health agencies are tasked with a difficult job to keep COVID transmission under control. They could benefit from a system that provides them with an early and accurate warning of an increase in new COVIC infections in their jurisdiction. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project grew out of an interest to compare the available data from states that had experienced an outbreak vs. states that hadn't experienced an outbreak. As the analysis progressed it became clear that common statistical measures of COVID-19 infection spread that are utilized today--in particular, total cases, case rates, and positive test rates--are not all equally informative. One is better than the others, yet all of them have their shortcomings. Part of the project explores the shortcomings with the measures that are currently available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, this analysis helped to inform the idea of an alternative regional COVID-19 early warning system that addresses some of the shortcomings of the currently available tools. It could provide an early and accurate warning of an increase in new COVID infections, which could ultimately allow state governments and public health agencies to react sooner and keep an uptick from turning into an outbreak. This system is described in more detail [here](https://github.com/salvir1/covid-early-warning-system). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The high level goals of this project are:\n",
    "- To characterize the difference at the regional level between an uptick and an outbreak in COVID case rates\n",
    "- To develop statistics that could become the foundation of a COVID-19 earling warning system (described [here](https://github.com/salvir1/covid-early-warning-system))\n",
    "- To work with various EDA and data visualization tools and techniques\n",
    "\n",

    "## State groupings bring important trends to light\n",
    "\n",
    "As the COVID-19 epidemic unfolded in the US over the course of 2020, outbreaks came in waves. These waves were not uniform across the country. Rather, each of the three distinct identifiable waves had its own unique geographic distribution. Most states, thankfully, only experienced one wave. Many others avoided severe outbreaks altogether. For those that had an outbreak, they were costly in terms of lives lost. By grouping states together according to outbreak--and a fourth group of states that did not experience an outbreak--one can see these outbreaks clearly, and also see just how costly these outbreaks were. ([Click here](#State-groupings) to learn how and why these groups were constructed).\n",
    "\n",
    "The four charts below illustrate the outbreaks in different ways. The upper left chart shows daily deaths per 100,000 people for the four different groupings. The upper right chart shows daily new case diagnoses per 100,000 for the same groupings. The lower left chart shows the total new diagnoses made per day. Finally, the lower right chart shows the positive test rate per day. A discussion of these charts and related topics follow. ([Click here](#Large-charts) for larger versions of these charts).\n",

    "### Outbreak avoidance saves lives\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart of death rates shows that states with outbreaks experienced death rates that were many times worse than states with no outbreak over the same time period. The baseline daily death rate stayed below 0.25 per 100,000 if no outbreak was occurring. Death rates were three or more times higher for groupings that were experiencing an outbreak. The cost of an outbreak in terms of lives lost can be extrapolated by comparing the elevated death rate of an outbreak to baseline. For example, the states that experienced a summer outbreak had over 25,000 more deaths above baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time is critical to contain an emerging outbreak\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart of case rates shows a shared baseline among groups that weren't experiencing an outbreak. (Note that although the baseline wasn't uniform and rose a bit over the summer, there was little change in the death rate over that same time period. Much of the increase in case rate might be attributable to the vastly expanded testing availability that occurred during that period and allowed for more cases to be diagnosed). The successive outbreaks emerged quickly and rose steeply. The implicit message in the sharpness of the outbreak curves is that time is critical to contain an emerging outbreak.\n",
    "\n",
    "The curve becomes even more steep if we look at new actice infections, and not just those that were confirmed with a diagnosis. One recent study estimated as many as 3 to 20 more people may have been infected than those who were confirmed positive with a COVID test ([Wu](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18272-4)). There are many reasons why cases may go undiagnosed with a positive test. Some people infected with COVID are asymptomatic and do not know to get tested. A recent meta-analysis found that 17% of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic ([Byambasuren](https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/jammi-2020-0030). Others may develop symptoms but may not get tested. And there's false negatives from testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a conservative estimate of 2.5 infections for every diagnosis to get a picture of just how steep the actual infections curve looks (2.5x as steep to be precise). The green trendlines below show an estimate of new active infections for the states of Montana and Utah superimposed on graphs of diagnosed case rates.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time is critical: Old news is not good news\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast majority of positive cases (i.e. the numerator in all COVID monitoring metrics) comes from diagnostic tests of people who are symptomatic. Does reliance on confirmatory diagnostic tests add delay? People who become infected with COVID are thought to be shedding virus on average 2-3 days before they're symptomatic, if they're ever symptomatic ([Harvard](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus)). Once symptomatic, they then need to decide to get tested, get tested (probably depends on the severity of the infection--it could range from 1 day to never), and await for the test results find their way to the tracking system (which can be from 1 to several days). Simply adding up these numbers suggests that a positive test result could take 6 or more days from active, detectable infection to when it enters a tracking database. The infection estimates in the previous time series were shifted back 6 days to simulate when the new infections first became detectable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a test regimen and test process system that could shorten this delay from detectability? Many universities are utilizing surveillance systems where they're going looking for active infections and not waiting until they show up. Further discussion of this approach at the state level can be found [here](https://github.com/salvir1/covid-early-warning-system).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time is critical: Noisy data adds delay\n",
    "\n",
    "COVID testing regimens have been designed for other reasons than to provide a statistically accurate measure of the changing rate of infection in a population. As such, noise finds its way into the signal. For instance, the COVID test sites in a jurisdiction often test for different reasons. Clinics may be doing pre-procedural testing to confirm the absence of COVID pre-procedure. Positive test rates from these screening procedures will mirror disease prevalence among asymptomatic people with rates of 1-2% or lower. These clinics may perform these tests only a few days a week. Locations run by public health agencies may be testing mostly symptomatic people some days. These diagnostic tests may have positive test rates from these sites on these days may exceed 25% or more. At different days for these same public health agency locations, they may test a high percentage of asymptomatic students from a school or employees from a company, thus reducing the positive test rate significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "States report all submitted test reports in a single batch for a day regardless of whether they were screening tests or diagnostic tests. The ratio of screening tests to diagnostic tests can fluctuate significantly from day-to-day. Consequently, the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic people in a batched daily test report for a state can--and does--vary tremendously. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another layer of noise is introduced when test samples are processed at the labs and reported back. Test sites across a state may utilize different labs. Turnaround times for the various labs are often different. Some labs may batch tests and report several days worth of results at a time, where others report every 24 hours. Not only could this lack of process affect the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic people in a batched daily test report, it can have a big impact on the total number of tests reported on in any given day. Taken together, the fluctuating ratios of symptomatic to asymptomatic people in the test pool and the different batching methods contribute to noisiness in the signal from day-to-day. \n",
    "\n",
    "The high daily variability is clearly visible in COVID metrics in use today. The positive test rate and case rate charts for the state of Montana are below. Note the day-to-day variability. 'Control limit' horizontal lines have been added to each chart derived from  the mean values for the month of August plus two standard deviations to give a sense of the size of the variance. Once the moving average crosses the control limit line, it suggests an underlying change may have occurred to the mean. I.e. an outbreak may be emerging. For the chart on the right, two vertical lines have been added to indicate when the moving averages of the time series crossed the control limits--i.e. when their signals would have triggered a warning. The simulated warnings occur well after the new active infection rates have begun to rise.\n",

    "### A closer look at timing\n",
    "\n",
    "Governments and public health agencies are unlikely to drive the death rate down to zero until a vaccine is available, but they can work to avoid an outbreak and the associated costs of lives lost. Clearly, timing is important. By the time death rates start to increase, an outbreak has been many weeks in the making. While the death rate may be the most direct measure of the cost of the pandemic, it's a lagging indicator. Governments and public health agencies need an early warning system--a leading indicator or indicators--in order to have the best chance at keeping the rate of infections, and thus deaths, under control in their jurisdictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many state governments and public health agencies pay close attention to the daily updates of their COVID metrics, but the delays outlined above hinder the ability of their COVID monitoring systems to detect an outbreak in a timely fashion. Here are charts from two states working hard to stay ahead of outbreaks yet experiencing outbreaks nonetheless. Lines have been added to indicate when they notified the public of the recent outbreak and began to take action. Note how much the estimated new infections rate has risen by the time notification occurs. \n",

    "### Normalization of the data improves it\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the original four charts, one small but important detail to note is that normalizing data can make for better comparisons. The chart of *total cases diagnosed per day* isn't as clean of an indicator of an outbreak. In this graph, the trendline of total cases diagnosed in the *no outbreak* group rose almost as much as the trendline for the *summer outbreak* group. All trendlines rose heading into the fall even though the outbreak for the *fall outbreak* group has thus far been more severe. The normalization that occurs in the *case rate* chart more accurately sorts out the true signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "### We learned from the traumatic events of the spring how to reduce adverse outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "It's informative to compare the peaks in the trendlines between the *death rate* and the *case rate* charts. As one would expect, the peaks of the case rate trendlines happen earlier than the peaks of the death rate trendlines. What is less expected is the differences in their relative sizes. Fortunately, the peak of the summer outbreak death rate was less than half the size as that of the spring outbreak. The corresponding case rate peak was almost twice as large for the summer outbreak as it was for the spring outbreak. A likely explanation for some of the difference in death rates is that the medical community learned how to take better care of COVID patients over time. It's also likely that people who were most at risk to adverse outcomes from COVID were infected at lower rates in those places that experienced a summer outbreak than they were in locations that experienced a spring outbreak. It could be that we learned how to take better care of COVID patients and also improved our ability to keep the most vulnerable of us from getting infected with COVID in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Should we be looking more keenly at infection rates of COVID in people with high contact rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also informative to compare the height of the peaks of the death rate and case rate for the summer outbreak (and also for the fall outbreak although that story has not yet fully played out). The change in testing availability muddies things up a bit, but visually it appears as if the change in height of the case rate surpasses the change in height of the death rate. In other words, infection rates may have expanded more than death rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is plausible when one considers that neither transmission rates nor risk of adverse outcomes are uniform across a population. Taking the transmission rates first, transmission occurs through proximite human-to-human contact. One would expect people with higher contact rates to have higher rates of infection. *Indeed, one would expect the spread of COVID virus to be dependent upon those of us with higher contact rates.* Now, taking adverse outcomes into account, certain subsets of the population have much higher risk of death than others. Seventy-nine percent of COVID deaths in the US occurred in [people older than 65](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm). Continued emphasis must be on reducing transmission to this population. This knowledge could be used as the foundation for a targeted COVID surveillance system. We could monitor COVID infection rates among the most mobile of us where an outbreak will start to form first as one key element in a strategy to minimize transmission to the most vulnerable of us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State groupings\n",
    "\n",
    "How were these groupings made? For this analysis, states were grouped into one of four categories based upon season and severity of an outbreak in terms of daily deaths reported per 100,000. An outbreak was defined at the state level according to criteria desribed in the states analysis section. When rolled up to the state grouping level, the daily death rate exceeded 0.25 per 100,000 population for an outbreak. Outbreaks for the spring, summer, and fall began prior to 4/1/20, 7/1/20, and 10/1/20 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spring outbreak\n",
    "- Occurred primarily in the northeast, Great Lakes region, and Louisiana\n",
    "- Exceeded 0.8 deaths per 100,000 per day between June and August\n",
    "- About 90M people are in this group\n",
    "\n",
    "Summer outbreak\n",
    "- Occurred primarily in the southeast and Arizona\n",
    "- Exceeded 40 cases per 100,000 per day or 0.5 deaths per 100,000 per day between June and August\n",
    "- About 89M people are in this group\n",
    "\n",
    "Fall outbreak\n",
    "- Upper midwest and Arkansas at this time with more states to be added if they meet the threshholds\n",
    "- Exceeded 40 cases per 100,000 per day or 0.5 deaths per 100,000 per day after August\n",
    "- About 16M people are in this group\n",
    "\n",
    "No outbreak\n",
    "- Avoided classification in one of the other outbreak categories\n",
    "- About 133M people are in this group\n",
    "\n",
    "The state groupings help to sort the state trends in a meaningful way. One can see this by attempting to look at the death rate trendline at the state level for just 25 states. The chart below of daily COVID death rates by state over time is a confusion of squiggly lines, although one can start to see patterns if one looks long enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" src=\"img/COVID-deaths-by-state-large-group.png\" width='1000' height='auto' ></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The state level trendlines become more understandable when states are presented in the same groupings as before. The following charts display the COVID statistics of death rate, case, rate, and positive test rate, but now at the state level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state-level charts eveal the dangerous acceleration of a COVID outbreak more clearly. Note the steep upward trajectory of deaths and case rates for a number of states that experienced an outbreak. This underscores the importance of time in identifying a potential outbreak. Once an outbreak begins it can grow quickly and leave state governments and public health agencies scrambling to try to get ahead of a steep curve.  \n",

    "- The rapid ramp-ups of the summer and fall outbreaks suggest an early warning system may be necessary to *see* an emerging outbreak before its too late. By the time the trends start to change in the case rate data it may be too late to avoid an outbreak. \n",
    "- The peaks for the three different outbreaks get larger over time. This mirrors testing availability, which points to a major shortcoming of the COVID surveillance systems that states are using today. Longitudinal comparisons of case counts or case rates are muddied by the fact that testing has become more widespread over time. Some public officials have dismissed rising case counts as simply a result of more testing, but the outbreaks identified in this analysis correspond to the one metric that truly matters--sharply rising death rates.\n",

    "- Very noisy signal--Seattle Times reports it using a 28 day moving average (as compared to 14 days for cases and deaths)\n",
    "- Why? \n",
    "- Test sites might have inherent differences in the types of people being tested. Clinics may be doing pre-procedural testing to confirm patients don't have COVID. Positive test rates from these sites will approximate disease prevalence among asymptomatic people, which is a very low number. Many of these clinics perform these tests only a few days a week.\n",
    "- Locations run by public health agencies may be testing mostly symptomatic people on some of the days when they're open. Positive test rates from these sites on these days may exceed 25% or more.\n",
    "- At different days for these same public health agency locations, they may test a high percentage of asymptomatic students from a school or employees from a company, thus reducing the positive test rate significantly.\n",
    "- Different types of test methods have different false positive/false negative rates. If the balance of tests shifts (which is what we are seeing right now with more antigen detection rapid tests), this is going to result in differences in positive test rates.\n",
    "- The number of tests from these different locations from different days will vary dramatically. Results from these tests get pooled together for reporting purposes, thus causing the positive test rate number to fluctuate for reasons that have nothing to do with changes in the actual infection rate."

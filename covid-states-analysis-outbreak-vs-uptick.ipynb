    "## COVID Early Warning System Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an attempt to define a good early warning indicator for COVID outbreaks. States and public health agencies have a difficult job to keep COVID transmission under control. They could benefit from a system that provides them an early and accurate warning of an increase in new COVIC infections in their jurisdiction that has a strong probability of becoming an outbreak. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project grew out of an interest to compare the available data from states that had experienced an outbreak vs. states that hadn't experienced an outbreak. As the analysis progressed it became clear that the common statistical measures of COVID-19 infection spread that are utilized today--total cases, case rates, and positive test rates--are not all equally informative. One is better than the others, yet all of them have their shortcomings. Part of the project explores the shortcomings with the measures that are currently available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, this analysis helped to inform the idea of an alternative regional COVID-19 early warning system that addresses some of the shortcomings of the currently available tools and could provide an early and accurate warning of an increase in new COVID infections, which could ultimately allow state governments and public health agencies to react sooner and keep an uptick from turning into an outbreak. This system is described in more detail [here](https://github.com/salvir1/covid-early-warning-system). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The high level goals of this project are:\n",
    "- To characterize the difference at the regional level between an uptick and an outbreak in COVID case rates\n",
    "- To develop statistics that could become the foundation of a COVID-19 earling warning system (described [here](https://github.com/salvir1/covid-early-warning-system))\n",
    "- To work with various EDA and data visualization tools and techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and techniques used in this project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools**\n",
    "- Python, Jupyter Lab, SciKitLearn, Pandas, Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization**\n",
    "- Plotly, Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques**\n",
    "- Spatial mapping, simple moving average, simulation"

    "### Comparing trends at the state level\n",
    "\n",
    "The state groupings help to sort the state trends in a meaningful way. One good way to see this is to look at the death rate trendline at the state level for just 25 states. The chart below of daily COVID death rates by state over time is a confusion of squiggly lines, although one can start to see patterns if one looks long enough. \n",

    "<img align=\"center\" src=\"img/COVID-deaths-by-state-large-group.png\" width='1000' height='auto' ></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The state level trendlines become more understandable when states are presented in the same groupings as before. The following charts display the same COVID statistics as above (except for total cases which isn't that helpful of a metric), but now at the state level.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" src=\"img/COVID-deaths-by-state.png\" width='1000' height='auto' ></img>\n",

    "\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" src=\"img/COVID-positive-test-rate-by-state.png\" width='1000' height='auto' ></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "While the groupings help to make sense of the state level data, there's one obvious problem with most of the trendlines no matter which grouping they fall into. They're all very noisy. If one is looking at these signals to determine if there's been an underlying and important shift in the rate of new COVID infections, the variability is going to cloud that decision and cause delay. This will be discussed more in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to display changes over time at the state level is with an animation. Animations were constructed to demonstrate the dynamic ebb and flow of COVID-19 over time by state. These three animations show the geographic progression of the outbreaks over time. (Due to the limitations of the Github repo to run html in markdown language, you may need to copy the html files to a local folder and then open them to see the animation. Links to the files are here. They can be found in the img directory of this repo.)\n",

    "- Very noisy signal--Seattle Times reports it using a 28 day moving average (as compared to 14 days for cases and deaths)\n",
    "- Why? \n",
    "- Test sites might have inherent differences in the types of people being tested. Clinics may be doing pre-procedural testing to confirm patients don't have COVID. Positive test rates from these sites will approximate disease prevalence among asymptomatic people, which is a very low number. Many of these clinics perform these tests only a few days a week.\n",
    "- Locations run by public health agencies may be testing mostly symptomatic people on some of the days when they're open. Positive test rates from these sites on these days may exceed 25% or more.\n",
    "- At different days for these same public health agency locations, they may test a high percentage of asymptomatic students from a school or employees from a company, thus reducing the positive test rate significantly.\n",
    "- Different types of test methods have different false positive/false negative rates. If the balance of tests shifts (which is what we are seeing right now with more antigen detection rapid tests), this is going to result in differences in positive test rates.\n",
    "- The number of tests from these different locations from different days will vary dramatically. Results from these tests get pooled together for reporting purposes, thus causing the positive test rate number to fluctuate for reasons that have nothing to do with changes in the actual infection rate."
